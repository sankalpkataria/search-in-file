## Usage As command line tool

To use this as a command line tool install this package globally using `-g` command.

Now, run command

```
search-in-file <text-to-search>
```

For example,

```
search-in-file hello
```

This will search for text `"hello"` in all the files from a directory where the command is run.

> `search-in-file hello world` will search for text having either `"hello"` or `"world"`. To search for `hello world`, use `search-in-file "hello world"`.
> I.e. to search for text having more than one word, enclose the text in `quotes`.

`-w`, `--word` : Search for exact word?

`-i`, `--ignore-case` : Ignore case while searching?

`--reg` : Consider "text-to-search" as regex?

`-r`, `--recursive` : Search recursively in sub-directories of a directory

`-e <exclude-dir>`, `--exclude-dir <exclude-dir>` : Directory/file(s) to exclude while searching

`-f <file-mask>`, `--file-mask <file-mask>` : Search in files with specific extension. Example: `".txt"`, `".js"`

`-s <type>`, `--search-results <type>` : Type of search result. `"filePaths"`/`"lineNo"`. Default: filePaths
